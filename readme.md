## Reason

This file **Export All Groups with Their Layers.jsx** is the result of deep anger...ðŸ˜¡ No, I am kidding.ðŸ˜‚ Having conducted several searches on the net (YouTube, Stack Overflow and others) looking for a way to export the grouped layers while maintaining their names and respective positions from Photoshop...Therefore, being a developer, having some knowledge in JavaScript, and followed by some thoughts, I was able to develop this wonderful solution allowing you to confidently export all your layers after grouping them all...and to tell you the truth, I'm still proud of the result.ðŸ˜ƒ

## Usage

Place **Export All Groups with Their Layers.jsx** file in your folder **"C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop 2020\Presets\Scripts\"** and restart Photoshop. Scripts are now acsessible through Photoshop **"File > Scripts > Export All Groups with Their Layers"** menu items.

OR
